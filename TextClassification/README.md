Use tf-idf as feature, build machine learning model to identify the topic of the text. Use python-flask to deploy the model.

# Build model
- Parse string data using regular expression match. Tokenize, remove stopwords and
punctuations, lemmatize words.
- Select features(words) and form tf-idf vector to represent a document, build training dataset
for sklearn classifiers
- Complete classification tasks using logistic regression, randomforest, na√Øve bayes classifier.
Use cross validation to find the best hyperparameter setting.
- Generate f1 score and confusion matrix for each class prediction

See ```model/demo.ipynb``` for more details

# Deploy model
Use python-flask to deploy a web-based Email classfication app. Develop functionalities of sign-up, log-in,  profile modification, text classification etc.

## Use Docker

### Install Docker
See more details in [Docker document](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Build Docker image

Clone the repository and enter into the folder that contains DockerFile
```git clone https://github.com/balancehy/nlp.git```
```cd ../nlp/TextClassification/dockerimage```

Start Docker. Build Docker image by running
```docker build . -t "ImageName"```

If taking a close look, the source files are copied to the image path ```ImageName:Version/code``` and the python environment is set up using ```requirement.txt```
